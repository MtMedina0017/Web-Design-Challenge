        <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as
          you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first
          pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on
          over 500 cities.</p>

        <p>After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various
          asepcts of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included:
          tempurature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and
          visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends
          and correlations witnessed.</p>
